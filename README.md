# nativescript-dev-assets

This simple `before-prepare` hook will make an `assets` folder in your app folder, all files in it will be synced in the `platforms/android/src/main/assets` folder. 

Basically to fix this [issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/android-runtime/issues/700) and to ease [nativescript-lottie](https://github.com/bradmartin/nativescript-lottie) usage under android.

# Installation

`tns install nativescript-dev-assets`

# Usage

Just put files in the `app/assets` folder
